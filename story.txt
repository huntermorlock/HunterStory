Kathy the kangaroo crossed the street. She hopped from California to Conneticut. It took her quite awhile.
The weather changed every single day she hopped. Some days it was raining, some days it was sunny, and some days it was raining meatballs. One day she met her friend Kim who can also change the weather. So they made a both sunny and rainy day.
