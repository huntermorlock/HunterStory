Kathy the kangaroo crossed the street. She hopped from California to Conneticut. It took her quite awhile.
The weather changed every single day she hopped. Some days it was raining, some days it was sunny, and some days it was raining meatballs. One day she met her friend Kim who can also change the weather. So they made a both sunny and rainy day. Kim was very talented meteorologist, and as we know, meteorologist control the weather. So 
Kathy decide to become her best friend so she could always ask her to change the weather when it was rainy and gloomy.
Kathy lived the rest of her life in joy as the weather was always very sunny. Kathy would be able to hop from California to Connecticut whenever she pleased.
